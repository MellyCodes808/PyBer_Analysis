Analysis overview

  The purpose of this analysis is to examine the ride-share data by city type (Urban, Rural, Suburban). By digging into the data, we will be able to identify trends and allow stakeholders to make more strategic decisions.

Results

  After pulling together key metrics, we were able to identify key differences in the data. The Rural areas have the least rides but the highest average fare per city and fare per driver. This phenomenon is likely caused by the number of drivers. Rural areas have 13x fewer rides than the Urban type, however, Urban areas have 30x more drivers. We conclude that this has an impact on the average fare per driver.
The Suburban Type has 5x more rides than rural areas, and proportionally a little over 6x more drivers than the rural type. They also profit 4x the amount of rural cities while charging $16.00 less. Urban cities have the highest total rides, drivers and profitability. All while being able to charge the cheapest fare and fare per driver. Urban rides make up the majority of our dataset, so we can conclude that fare price and ridership is highly correlated.

  Here, we see that Urban areas are the most profitable for the company, with a significantly higher total fares. We can also see that the profits peak in February and March for Urban and Suburban types, and in April for Rural areas. Also of note, it looks like Profits are at their lowest in January for all areas. 

Conclusion and Limitations 

  Based on the above insights, I recommend that efforts are put towards lowering fares in rural and suburban areas. This is correlated with higher ridership. I would also recommend marketing focus on raising ridership and recruiting drivers in rural and suburban areas. This could be done by offering promotions for lower rides or offering drivers higher pay. This would help discover if ridership is directly impacted by price, the quantity of drivers or by some other variable, such as higher vehicle ownership. 
 Some disparities in the data include that higher populations and lower miles traveled in urban areas naturally lead to higher rides and lower fares (since passengers are likely to travel shorter distances.). Rural areas are usually more sparsely packed than urban areas, leading them to travel longer distances and thus pay higher fares. Urban populations are also less likely than rural and suburban types to not own vehicles. Making them more likely to travel with ride-share companies. More EDA would need to be done to identify the impact that urban, rural and suburban lifestyles including population, distance and vehicle ownership have on the trends in this data.
